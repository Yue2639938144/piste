# PISTE: Physics Inspired Sliding TransformEr

This repository provides implementations and code examples for [Physics Inspired Sliding TransformEr (PISTE)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00901-y). 
PISTE is a physics-inspired transformer that employs mode-seeking dynamics to guide the positioning of amino acid residues along the gradient field of their interactions, enabling accurate modeling and prediction of TCR-antigen-HLA binding.
